# CSS
## Basic CSS for front-end development.

Welcome to Introduction to CSS3. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, a method of styling your HTML documents with various colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing. But that is just the beginning. You can also do some "cool" stuff such as creating transitions or adding animations. There are so many things you can do with CSS, that we focus on the following:

1. Rules and syntax (how to write CSS code)
2. Simple styling (fonts, colors, borders)
3. More styling (background images and opacity)
4. Positioning - how to get the different parts of your page to go where you want them to go
5. Pseudo-classes - styling things that aren't even there!

Throughout the entire course there will be an emphasis on the importance of accessibility. Not only will you style your site, but you will test it and other sites on the POUR accessibility principles to ensure that your styling is enhancing your site, not putting up unseen roadblocks.
